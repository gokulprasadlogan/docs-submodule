# Feature/Functionality Proposal Document

### 1. Title
**Feature Name**: _Contact Form Validation_

**Version**: 1.0

**Date**: February 7, 2025

---

### 2. Objective
Provide a brief description of what the feature aims to achieve.  
**Example**:  
"Implement a contact form with client-side validation to ensure that the email field is correctly filled before submission. This will enhance user experience and reduce errors."

---

### 3. Reason for the Feature
Explain why this feature is needed. This could include any issues you're solving or improvements you're making.  
**Example**:  
"Currently, users can submit the contact form with an empty or incorrectly formatted email address. By implementing validation, we can prevent these errors and ensure better data collection."

---

### 4. Scope
Clearly define what will be included in this feature and what won't.  
**Example**:  
- **Included**:  
    - Create a new form with a single email field.  
    - Add client-side validation to ensure the email is not empty and is in the correct format.
- **Not Included**:  
    - Backend validation (will be handled in a future update).
    - Implementing a database to store the email addresses (this will be handled in another ticket).

---

### 5. Approach / Implementation Details
Outline how you plan to implement the functionality, including technologies or frameworks used.  
**Example**:  
"I will implement this feature using React, leveraging the built-in form handling features. Validation will be done using JavaScript regular expressions to check for valid email formats. If the email is invalid, the form's submit button will remain disabled until the email is corrected."

**Libraries/Technologies**:  
- React (for form handling)
- JavaScript/Regular Expressions (for email validation)

---

### 6. Expected Outcome
Describe what the desired result is once the feature is implemented.  
**Example**:  
"The form should prevent submission if the email field is empty or contains an invalid email address. The user will see a relevant error message below the email input field."

---

### 7. Potential Risks or Challenges
Identify any potential issues or challenges with the feature implementation.  
**Example**:  
"Ensuring the email format validation covers all edge cases, such as emails with special characters or very long domain names. We'll need to thoroughly test to avoid excluding valid email formats."

---

### 8. Impact
Outline the potential impact of implementing this feature.  
**Example**:  
- **Positive**:  
    - Improved user experience by preventing form submission errors.
    - Better data quality by ensuring valid emails are collected.
- **Negative**:  
    - Might require minor design adjustments to display validation error messages.

---

### 9. Testing Plan
Provide a plan for testing the feature once it's implemented.  
**Example**:  
"The form will be tested by entering valid and invalid email addresses to ensure that the validation works as expected. Additional testing will be performed on various browsers and devices."

---

### 10. Timeline
Provide a rough estimate of how long it will take to implement and test the feature.  
**Example**:  
- **Implementation**: 2 days  
- **Testing & Deployment**: 1 day
